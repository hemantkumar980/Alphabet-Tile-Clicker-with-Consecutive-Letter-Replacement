# Alphabet-Tile-Clicker-with-Consecutive-Letter-Replacement
it displays a tile for every letter in the alphabet in uppercase format. Then if a tile is clicked, that letter is appended to the current string that exists in the element with ID outputString. If at any point there are 3 consecutive letters that are the same, replace them with an underscore. For example, if A, B, C, F, F, F, G is clicked in that order, the string that appears in outputString would be ABC_G. If 6 of the same letter appears after, for example, clicking A six times followed by a B, then outputstring would be _B.
